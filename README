#Hello World : Getting started with Python


This is a simple "Hello, World!" project for Python which will (eventually)
be modified to auto-update itself when it detects a newer version of itself
has been pushed to github. Just an excuse to learn a bit about Python,
really, and to eventually serve as a jumping-off point for new projects.
